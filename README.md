# E-commerce Flask Backend For SC

A Flask-based integration project running on Google Cloud.

This project provides a backend service that integrates WooCommerce with the WhatsApp Cloud API and includes a fully functional chatbot system. Incoming customer messages are processed through a Flask webhook, allowing automated responses, trigger-based actions, and future AI model integration (e.g., Gemini). Additionally, the backend sends real-time WhatsApp notifications for new WooCommerce orders, enabling streamlined communication for e-commerce operations.
